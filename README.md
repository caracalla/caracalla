# Welcome to my Web Zone

Hi, I'm James, and I write C++ at a big internet company.  For fun, I like to work on various projects, spanning real time 3D rendering,
language learning, and web technologies.

I also have a blog, although it's pretty barren right now: https://caracal.la

## Projects
* [buffdog](https://github.com/caracalla/buffdog) - A real time 3D software renderer in C++ whose only dependency is SDL, which handles input and outputting the final rendered image to the screen.  It's also kind of a game engine in progress.
* [jukugo](https://github.com/caracalla/jukugo) - A full stack JS (Node, Mongo, React) web app for learning Japanese words based on the kanji the user has already learned elsewhere.
* [quake](https://github.com/caracalla/quake) - An archaelogical exploration of the timeless classic.  I'm pondering adapting it into my own custom engine; it's a race between this and buffdog.

## Other Stuff
* [dotfiles](https://github.com/caracalla/dotfiles)
* [note-to-self](https://github.com/caracalla/note-to-self) - personal documentation

## Everything Else
...is garbage and you shouldn't look at it.
